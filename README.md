## Run the app directly from instance deployed in AWS EC2

Try http://13.236.184.156/candidates in browser.
Replace "localhost:8080" with "13.236.184.156" for all the command below if you wish to test the api deployed in AWS EC2.
```sh
curl -v "13.236.184.156/candidates/scoregreater/90"
```

## Usage

You may test the scirpt via various tools like browsers and postman, I will show how to use curl to test the api in windows cmd or linux below. (add -v after curl to show detailed info)
1. Show all candidates
```sh
curl -v "localhost:8080/candidates"
```
2. Show single candidate by ID, if exist, that candidate will be returned. 
```sh
curl "localhost:8080/candidates/1"
```
3. Show single candidate by ID, if not exist, Not found info will be returned. 
```sh
curl "localhost:8080/candidates/99"
```
4. Search candidates by fname, lname or email (you can give any combination of these 3 fields).
```sh
curl “localhost:8080/candidates?fname=Thomas&lname=Yang”
```
```sh
curl “localhost:8080/candidates?email=thomas.y2022@gmail.com”
```
5. Search candidates by minimum score
```sh
curl “localhost:8080/candidates/scoregreater/80"
```
6. Create candidate with fname, lname and email (id will be generated automatically)
```sh
curl -v -X POST "localhost:8080/candidates" -H "Content-type:application/json" -d "{\"fname\": \"aaa\", \"lname\": \"bbb\", \"email\":\"aaa@gmail.com\"}"
```
7. Create candidate with fname, lname, email and score (id will be generated automatically)
```sh
curl -v -X POST "localhost:8080/candidates" -H "Content-type:application/json" -d "{\"fname\": \"mmm\", \"lname\": \"nnn\", \"email\":\"mmm@gmail.com\", \"score\":80}"
```
8. Update candidate with id
```sh
curl -v -X PUT "localhost:8080/candidates/4" -H "Content-type:application/json" -d "{\"fname\": \"xxx\", \"lname\": \"yyy\", \"email\":\"xxx@gmail.com\", \"score\":90}"
